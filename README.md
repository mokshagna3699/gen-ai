# 📰 Financial News Entity Extraction using Gen AI

This project uses **Generative AI** and **NLP** to extract key financial entities from news articles. It identifies companies, people, stock tickers, financial events, monetary values, and more—helping automate financial research and analysis.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Extracts **financial entities**: companies, people, tickers, dates, events, monetary values  
- Uses **Generative AI (LLMs)** for precise domain-aware extraction  
- Cleans, preprocesses, and structures news articles  
- Outputs entities in **JSON format**  
- Modular pipeline for easy extension  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python**
- **Generative AI Models** (OpenAI / HuggingFace)
- **spaCy / Transformers**
- **FastAPI or Streamlit** (optional API/UI)

## 🧠 How It Works
1. **Input**: Raw financial news text  
2. **Preprocessing**: Cleaning + tokenization  
3. **LLM Extraction**: Gen AI identifies entities  
4. **Output**: Clean JSON with extracted entities

## 📦 Example Output
```json
{
  "company": ["Tesla", "Apple"],
  "person": ["Elon Musk"],
  "event": ["earnings report"],
  "monetary_value": ["$3.2B"],
  "date": ["2025-01-10"]
}
